# About this small project :

    " it's allow you to create liquidity pool on pancakeSwap using 
      Solidity and Brownie "


# Requirements :

    - Python, Brownie installed
    - I tested on Binance smart chain mainnet (forked) 
    - How to add a forked network on Brownie
       ' brownie networks add development chain-name-fork cmd=ganache-cli host=http://127.0.0.1 fork=RPC_URL accounts=10 mnemonic=brownie port=8545'

       ps : you need to change RPC_URL by endpoint, I use Moralis.

    I think that's all please if you have any question Discord : Mowgli#7713

# Why
    - I made this project to learn how to interact with protocols such Pancake 
        but the documentations is like empty so I decided to stop here

    - In the few next days I will make a project to interact with uniswap.

# Note / Probelems ?
